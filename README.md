# 1. Make new friends for life!
If I could go back in time and meet my younger self I would thank him for deciding to start skateboarding and slap him on the head for nearly breaking my ankles. We shared everything about our troubled teenage minds to assist us with our problems. Skateboard friends are the best ones you can have (with a few exceptions) and they stay friends for life, even if you donâ€™t see each other for years.

# 2. For all ages!
Skateboarding is for all ages and not just for kids. I know people that started skateboarding in their 30s and got pretty skilled. Sure it takes a bit more effort when youâ€™re older but anyone can learn how to skateboard. I see older and younger skateboarders enjoying their passion together, age doesnâ€™t matter.

# 3. Progression is rewarding!
Once you get the basics and know how to balance youâ€™ll start to progress. Tricks that seemed impossible are now within reach. Practicing over and over again until you land a trick after 300 attempts is one of the best feelings in the world. Your dedication pays off and you earned respect.

As you keep practicing you notice you progress more and more, at some point youâ€™ll pop that kickflip 9 out of 10 times.
