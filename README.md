# Why start skateboarding?
## A short list inspired by a friend on a Friday Afternoon!

# 1. Make new friends for life!
If I could go back in time and meet my younger self I would thank him for deciding to start skateboarding and slap him on the head for nearly breaking my ankles. We shared everything on our troubled teenage minds to assist us on our problems. Skateboard friends are the best ones you can have (with a few exceptions) and they stay friends for life, even if you don’t see each other for years.

# 2. For all ages!
Skateboarding is for all ages and not just for kids. I know people that started skateboarding in their 30’s and got pretty skilled. Sure it takes a bit more effort when you’re older but anyone can learn how to skateboard. I see older and younger skateboarders enjoying their passion together, age doesn’t really matter.

# 3. Progression is rewarding!
Once you get the basics and know how to balance you’ll start to progress. Tricks that seemed impossible are now within reach. Practicing over and over again until you land a trick after 300 attempts is one of the best feelings in the world. Your dedication pays off and you earned respect.

As you keep practicing you notice you progress more and more, at some point you’ll pop that kickflip 9 out of 10 times.
